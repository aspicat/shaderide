The project was initialized during OpenGL learning sessions to have a better
understanding of GLSL shaders with realtime preview. There are already a couple of
web solutions online, but I wanted a native application for Windows and Linux with
an export function to use my shaders also in other projects and to have the ability
to extend the application and make backups of my shader projects.

## Releases
See CHANGELOG.md for detailed release notes.

## Build
You need the following libraries:
* Qt6 Core, Gui, Widgets, OpenGL - 6.0.0
* Boost Libraries - 1.69
* OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) - 0.9.9

See CMakeLists.txt for further instructions.

## Usage
The editor should be quite intuitive. On the left side you can find the
3D preview. On the other side is the code section for the shader source codes.
The shader compilation error log is positioned at the bottom of the main window.

The 3D viewport can be controlled with the mouse. Left mouse button rotates the object.
Keep middle mouse pressed and move up and down the mouse to translate
the model back and forth. With the right mouse button pressed you can move the camera.

Note the gear icon at the bottom right corner of the code editor. You may
apply fixed texture slots (tex0 - tex3) for the four predefined sampler2D uniforms, which
may be used for albedo, normal, metalness and roughness textures for example.

## Shader Variables
The following predefined shader variables are supported as of version 1.3.0:

### Vertex Shader
* **in vec3 position**
* **in vec3 normal**
* **in vec2 uv**

### Fragment Shader
* **uniform sampler2D tex0**
* **uniform sampler2D tex1**
* **uniform sampler2D tex2**
* **uniform sampler2D tex3**

### Uniforms (All Shaders)
* **uniform float time**
* **uniform vec2 resolution**
* **uniform vec2 mousePos**
* **uniform mat4 modelMat**
* **uniform mat4 viewMat**
* **uniform mat4 projectionMat**

### Shared (Default Code)
* **out/in vec3 vPosition**
* **out/in vec3 vNormal**
* **out/in vec2 vUV**
* **out/in mat4 vMVP**
