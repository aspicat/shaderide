# Changelog

You can find all changes in detail per version in this file.
The listed notes are not ordered by priority.

## Version 1.4.0 - December 12, 2020
### Added
- JetBrains Mono as default font for the code editor and all other monospaced fonts used within
  the application.
  
### Changed
- Updated the Qt version to 6.0.0.
- Removed Boost serialization dependencies.

## Version 1.3.0 - July 18, 2020
### Added
- Uniform variable "uniform vec2 resolution", which holds the viewport screen resolution.
- Drag and drop support for project files.
- Basic search bar for shader code editors (Ctrl + F).
- Testing environment with project test module.
- Prepared SPIR-V export in code, but disabled due to incompatibility with legacy GLSL code
  yet. This might be a feature for an upcoming major release with Vulkan and/or OpenGL 4.6 support.

### Changed
- General code refactoring and clean up.
- Added separate plane 2D VAO to decouple the plane mesh from other preview objects.
- Layout changes are now stored automatically on exit.
- Set the FPS limit to 60 by changing the one shot delay from 33ms to 16.33ms (rounded).
- Project files can now contain all images as Base64 within the JSON file format. This excludes the
  requirement to have the files stored on the computer with an absolute path. This is also an improvement
  to painlessly exchanging the projects. Another advantage might be the ability to parse the project
  file in web services for WebGL etc. in future versions.

## Version 1.2.0 - December 6, 2019
### Added
- Toggle word wrap via "Code" menu.
- Highlight current cursor line in code editor (grey block).
- Scrollbar stylesheets.
- General settings dialog via "File/Settings..." now available.
- Log output counter with automatic cleanup.
- Realtime shader compilation when code has changed.
- Added state icons for toggleable menu entries.
- Added "Torus" model to preview models.

### Changed
- General code cleanup.
- Split stylesheet definitions into multiple headers.
- Models load in a separate thread now.
- Project files base on JSON now, instead of using boost::serialization.

### Fixed
- Layout sizes in splitter (width_left, width_right) were not saved for maximized window.
  Fixed by applying layout settings first.
